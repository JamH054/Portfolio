            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am from the southside of Chicago. I have come from middle class household.
             I have had the chance to travel to different places around the world. 
             As of right now I am giving myself 100% in this program so I can be successful. 
              I know its going to take a lot of work but it will be worth it. </p>
